## CAUTION
**If you're reading this after June 2023, this code no longer works after major changes to Twitter's API. If you have access to the paid tier API service, you might find this serviceable with some refactoring.**

The primary function of this script is to bulk-identify a set of Twitter users that match given search keywords on Google. 

By using a Google search for user-created Twitter lists, we can quasi-crowdsource a large number of accounts by matching lists to the keywords being searched for. Using Tweepy to access the user objects of each user in the lists, a dataset of users tailored for any application can be generated with relative ease. 

Note that this script will take a few minutes to run to prevent Google or Twitter locking us out for making too many requests in a short time period. 

To utilize the script you will need access to the Twitter API. Set up an account and project with Twitter Development here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access. 

No Google search authentication is required, as the googlesearch Python module it utilized. Module repo and documentation available here: https://github.com/MarioVilas/googlesearch
